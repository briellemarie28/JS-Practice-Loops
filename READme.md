Using exam 1 from bootcamp as practice - instructions below

Declare and initialize the following variables with appropriate values:
○ name (string) - Mitch Cuckovich
○ age (number) - 25
○ birthday (string) - January 24
○ detroitGC (boolean) - choose either true or false
○ lifeEvents (array with 4 items. 4 important life events)
■ "I was born in Troy, Michigan.",
■ "I went to Hope College",
■ "I went to Junior Olympics when I was 10 years old. I placed 14th in the
nation in the 800 meter event.",
■ "I'm a graduate of the front-end bootcamp."
● Write an if/else statement that runs one of two console.log methods. Your console.log
methods must incorporate the variables: name, age, and birthday.
○ If detroitGC is true, log the following message to the console:
■ My name is name and I am a student at Grand Circus in Detroit, Michigan.
I am currently age years old and my birthday is on birthday.
○ else
■ My name is name and I am a student at Grand Circus in Grand Rapids,
Michigan. I am currently age years old and my birthday is on birthday.
● Write a for loop that starts at 0 and iterates by increments of 1 while i is less than the
length of the lifeEvents array. Each iteration of the loop should log a new sentence
from the lifeEvents array. You should only have one console.log method.
● Declare and initialize a variable named counter to the value of 0.
● Write a while loop that loops while true.
○ Declare a variable named randomNumber that is initialized to a random integer
between 1 and 10. Google search how to do this.
○ Write an if/else statement that has two conditions
■ If randomNumber is not equal to 5
● Increment counter
● Use a console.log method to say: “randomNumber !== 5”
■ Else
● Increment counter
● Use a console.log method to say: “5 === 5. It took counter
iterations to randomly generate the number 5.”
● Break
